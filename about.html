					Harper Rhett
					<br>
					Independent Game Developer Since July of 2019
					<br>
					<br>
					On my 17th birthday I came across a copy of Game Maker Studio 2 that I had forgotten about, and after a few tutorials, I was immediately hooked.
					I was so hooked in fact, that my high school grades would drop inversely to the time I spent programming.
					Probably the only time I would take a break was during robotics team meetings, in which I would work on creating robots instead.
					<br>
					<br>
					Unfortunately, smack dab in the middle of the robotics season, the covid storm hit my school system.
					Everything was cancelled, and the only passion I had a chance to focus on was programming, so I started work on my first commercial game with the Unity game engine.
					Within two months, and a lot of help from an Argentinian music producer who was way too trusting in a high school senior, Factorama was born.
					The game was a total bust, and I lost about $80.
					All was not lost though, because in the process of uploading the game to the Android Play Store, Voltaic Studios was coined.
					<br>
					<br>
					If you were to continue to follow my story, you would find that I am now attending Auburn University for a computer science major.
					I have since joined the game developement club at Auburn, and hope to continue to create and publish games until I can build some sort of recognition.
					I can only hope that that recognition will one day land me a job, but until then, I hope you enjoy everything I'm able to pump out!
