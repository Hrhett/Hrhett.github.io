					Harper Rhett
					<br>
					Independent Game Developer Since July of 2019
					<br>
					<br>
					On my 17th birthday I came across a copy of Game Maker Studio 2 that I had long forgotten about, and after a few tutorials, I was immediately hooked.
					I was so hooked in fact, that my high school grades would drop inversely to the time I spent programming.
					Probably the only time I would take a break was during robotics team meetings, where instead of designing games, I was designing robots.
					<br>
					<br>
					These days, you can find me at Auburn University, studying computer science in hopes of one day joining the video game industry.
					I spend as much of my free time as possible creating games whenever I can, and I'm one of the officers of Auburn's game developement club, TigerDev.
					With several years of experience, I have lead many projects, I'm fluent in C#, Java, Lua, HTML, and CSS, and I have worked in GMS2, Unity, and Pico-8.
